NTU Math Undergraduate, working in NTU HCI Lab. I've been actively contributing to this group for the past year, participating in lively discussions and public events.

I also served as a workshop facilitator at the **2025 Taiwan AI Safety Summer Workshop**, where I presided over peer-to-peer discussions on alignment and safety.

**What got me into AI safety:** A desire to understand the meaning and beauty of intelligence and thought, and the belief that aligning artificial general intelligence may illuminate a deeper understanding of humans.

I share research takeaways to spark awareness within my Threads community.

**Expected graduation date:** July 31, 2026 (Expected to pursue a direct PhD at NTU.)
