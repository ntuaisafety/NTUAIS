lifelong polymath🌻

I’m Tzu, Chief of Staff at Atlas Computing, and an AGI preparedness advisor to decision-makers in Southeast Asia. I’ve done lots of operations work, career coaching (40+ to date), olympic barbell coaching (certified USAW Lvl2), and I’m a Spotify Top 0.01% Radiohead fan (2 straight years).

You can watch an award-winning documentary made about me.

In college, I’m usually known for this (advice for agentic undergrads) and this (founding 16 clubs) where I studied philosophy, comparative literature, and cognitive science.

I’ve been actively involved for 3+ years in the AGI safety / security community, having done operations for MATS, cofounded Caltech AI Alignment, ran Stanford AI Alignment, advising as a board member for Berkeley’s AI Safety, as well as 25 other top universities across the world. I represented Malaysia for the 2019 International Philosophy Olympiad, and subsequently founded a critical thinking nonprofit at 20 as a two-time Davis Fellow.

I often micro-blog my thoughts and document my growth in the form of instagram stories (you can view my story archives there). Also, proud vegan (mostly successful, sometimes flexitarian). Over at Tzu’s Newsletter – I sometimes write to my people.

And my speaker profile here, happy to advise on your AGI safety / security project, with priority given to people in government and industry.
