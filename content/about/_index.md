## Our Story

National Taiwan University AI Safety (NTUAIS) was founded in 2024 by students and researchers who saw a critical gap: as AI systems rapidly advanced — passing professional exams, writing code, and generating increasingly convincing text — Taiwan had almost no organized community studying how to make these systems safe.

What started as informal reading groups discussing foundational papers on alignment and interpretability has grown into a structured organization running multi-week fellowship programs, technical paper reading groups, and policy discussion sessions. Our programs draw on curricula from leading AI safety organizations and cover topics ranging from mechanistic interpretability and scalable oversight to AI governance and existential risk.

Now in our third year, NTUAIS connects students, professionals, and researchers across disciplines — computer science, philosophy, law, and public policy — because the challenge of making advanced AI systems safe and aligned with human values is too important and too multifaceted for any single field to tackle alone.
