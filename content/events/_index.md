Our programs are designed to give participants a real understanding of AI safety — from the technical foundations of alignment and interpretability to the governance and policy questions surrounding advanced AI systems.

## Key Tracks

Our main programs run throughout the year:

- **BlueDot Fellowship** — A 10-week introductory program covering AI threat models, safety techniques, and defence strategies
- **Technical Paper Reading** — 15-week deep engagement with current research in interpretability, alignment, oversight, and evaluation
- **Weekly Policy Reading** — AI governance and regulation discussions with NTU Law
