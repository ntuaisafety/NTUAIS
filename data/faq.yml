  - question: "Who are we?"
    answer: |
      We are the **National Taiwan University AI Safety Group** (NTUAIS). Since 2024, we've been building a community of researchers, students, and professionals focused on understanding and reducing risks from advanced AI systems. 2026 marks our **third year** running programs.

  - question: "What is AI Safety?"
    answer: |
      AI Safety is the field dedicated to ensuring that increasingly powerful AI systems remain **aligned with human values** and don't cause catastrophic harm — whether through misalignment, misuse, or systemic failures.

      Core research areas include **mechanistic interpretability** (understanding what models are actually doing internally), **alignment** (ensuring AI systems pursue intended goals), **scalable oversight** (supervising systems that may become smarter than their supervisors), and **AI governance** (building the institutions and policies needed to manage advanced AI responsibly).

      As AI systems grow more capable, these problems become more urgent. AI safety is widely recognized alongside biosecurity and nuclear risk as one of the most important challenges facing humanity.

  - question: "What do we do?"
    answer: |
      We run structured programs that cover the AI safety research landscape:
      - **BlueDot Fellowship** — A 10-week introductory program following the BlueDot Impact curriculum, covering threat models, defence layers, and safety techniques
      - **Technical Paper Reading** — A 15-week advanced program engaging directly with current research in interpretability, alignment, evaluation, and oversight
      - **Policy Reading Group** — Weekly discussions on AI governance, regulation, and institutional design, in collaboration with NTU Law

      We also help connect people in Taiwan to **international AI safety programs**, research opportunities, and the broader alignment community.

  - question: "Who should join?"
    answer: |
      Anyone who takes AI safety seriously and wants to develop real expertise. You don't need a computer science background — many of the hardest problems in AI safety require perspectives from **philosophy, law, policy, cognitive science**, and other fields. What matters is the willingness to engage with technical material and think carefully about difficult problems.

  - question: "How can I get involved?"
    answer: |
      1. **Join our Discord** — the best place to ask questions and meet the community
      2. **Apply for programs** — check our Events page for upcoming reading groups and fellowships
      3. **Show up!** 🍱 We provide bento at our events!
