I am a fourth-year Ph. D. student at the Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia at National Taiwan University. I am also a visiting scholar at Texas A&M University in FLAIR Lab, mentored by Prof. Kuan-Hao Huang and the Associate Learner in CLLab, advised by Prof. Hsuan-Tien Lin. Previously, I worked as a researcher at Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories for five years.

My research interests include diffusion models (generative models), preference alignment (AI safety), active learning (human-in-the-loop), and weakly supervised learning (limited-label learning). I also enjoyed promoting human thinking about AI safety and Ethics, specifically by organizing Taiwan AI Safety (TWAIS) Group which is supported by Effective Altruism (EA) community.
